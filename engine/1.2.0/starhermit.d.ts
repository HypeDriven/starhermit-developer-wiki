// StarHermit host API, version 1: the built-in modules a script game imports
// by name (`import { onUpdate } from "starhermit:engine"`). The runtime
// (`starhermit`) is the only trusted code; a game package is data, and every
// host object it receives is an opaque handle the runtime validates on each
// call.
//
// A game runs natively in the runtime's own interpreter and in browsers in
// the browser's engine (V8). What differs between the two (modules that
// import each other, built-ins only browsers have, local time, limits) is
// listed in spec/script-games.html, "Known differences between the native
// interpreter and V8"; `starhermit check` links the game's modules as
// browsers get them and warns of globals only browsers have.
//
// Conventions for every module:
//
// - Errors. A wrong argument type, a non-finite number where a number is
//   needed, or a handle that was disposed, forged or belongs to another
//   object throws a `TypeError`. Going past a limit (the manifest's
//   `engine.limits.*`, a per-frame bound, a size) throws a `RangeError`.
//   Where a web API is the model, its DOMException cases throw an `Error`
//   whose `name` is the DOMException name (`IndexSizeError`,
//   `SyntaxError`, `InvalidStateError`, `NotSupportedError`,
//   `InvalidAccessError`, `NotAllowedError`), so `e.name` checks port
//   unchanged. Platform calls reject with a `PlatformError`
//   (`starhermit:platform`). Once the runtime has asked the game to stop,
//   every host call throws.
// - Units. World distances are meters, angles radians (except
//   `PerspectiveCamera.fov`, degrees as in three.js), times seconds
//   (platform timestamps are milliseconds since the Unix epoch, as the
//   platform sends them), window coordinates physical pixels from the
//   top-left corner (`frame().scale` converts to logical pixels).
// - Colors (`ColorLike`) are sRGB: a CSS color string (`"#ff8800"`,
//   `"rgb(255 136 0 / 50%)"`, a named color), a `0xRRGGBB` number, or
//   `[r, g, b]` / `[r, g, b, a]` with components 0–1. Scene colors are
//   converted to linear light for lighting, as three.js does.
// - Light intensities keep the engine's convention: a white surface facing
//   a light of color 1 and intensity 1 shows its base color. three.js
//   r155+ divides direct and ambient light by π, so a ported light uses
//   `threeIntensity / Math.PI`.
// - Callbacks. Lifecycle callbacks are registered once at the top level of
//   the entry module; input events arrive at the start of each frame,
//   before `onFixedUpdate`. Asynchronous host work (asset loads, platform
//   calls, permission prompts) resolves promises between frames; waiting on
//   it costs no fuel and never counts as not responding.
// - Version. `engine.API_VERSION` is this file's major version (the
//   manifest's `engine.api=1`); minor versions only add members.
//
// Tools. The runtime carries this file and the developer commands, so a game
// needs nothing else: `starhermit new DIR` writes a new script game pinned to
// the runtime's engine release, `starhermit types DIR` writes this file as
// `DIR/.starhermit/starhermit.d.ts` (a dot-name, so no package carries it; the
// game's tsconfig.json lists it), `starhermit check DIR` validates the package
// and plays it headless, `starhermit DIR` plays it, `starhermit package
// --native DIR` writes its file index for a folder upload the StarHermit
// client installs and plays natively, and `starhermit package --web DIR --out
// UPLOAD` writes its web upload, its loader pinned to the same release on
// https://wiki.starhermit.com/engine/. `cargo starhermit` has the same
// commands for engine developers.
//
// Modules. Scripts are ECMAScript modules; `import` takes the built-in
// `starhermit:<module>` names and package files by a specifier relative to
// the importing file (`"./logic/pose.ts"`, `"../shared/sim.js"`); there are
// no bare specifiers, package-absolute paths or import maps. A specifier
// that names an existing package file loads it. Otherwise one ending in
// `.js` or `.mjs` loads the `.ts` or `.mts` file of the same stem (the
// TypeScript compiler's convention), and an extensionless one tries `.ts`,
// `.mts`, `.js` and `.mjs` in that order; directories are not resolved to
// an index file. A query string or fragment on a relative specifier
// (`"./settings.js?v=11"`, web cache-busting) is ignored for resolution:
// a module's identity is its resolved path, so `./a.js?v=1` and `./a.js`
// are one module, evaluated once. A specifier that resolves to nothing, or
// outside the package, ends the game on the error screen naming the
// importing file and the specifier. Dynamic `import()` resolves the same way and rejects
// instead. `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` with
// `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true` type-checks every accepted form.
//
// Language. Strict-mode ECMAScript 2022 plus TypeScript syntax (erased).
// BigInt is included (literals, operators, `BigInt.asIntN`/`asUintN`,
// `BigInt64Array`, `BigUint64Array`, DataView's BigInt accessors, exact
// `toLocaleString` and `Intl.NumberFormat`). A BigInt holds at most
// 1,048,576 bits (2^20, about 315,000 decimal digits; V8 allows more): a
// result past that is a `RangeError` ("Maximum BigInt size exceeded"), and
// large-number work counts against the script's fuel like any other. The
// host API takes no BigInt: numeric and data parameters throw a
// `TypeError` for one (convert with `Number(x)` or `String(x)` first),
// `JSON.stringify` (so storage, saves, workers and platform calls) throws,
// `BigInt64Array`/`BigUint64Array` are not accepted where a typed array of
// numbers is, and `starhermit:world` kernels refuse BigInt (their numbers
// are doubles). Scene property fields convert one as `Number(x)` does, as
// the browser's engine does. `console.log(12n)` prints `12n`.
// Of `Intl` and the locale-aware members, these follow the player's
// language (BCP 47 tags; others fall back to it): `String.prototype.
// localeCompare` and `Intl.Collator` (Unicode root collation with
// `sensitivity` and `numeric`), `String.prototype.normalize`,
// `Number.prototype.toLocaleString` and `Intl.NumberFormat` (`style`
// decimal, percent and unit, fraction and integer digit options,
// `useGrouping`), `Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString`/`TimeString`/
// `String` and `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (`dateStyle`, `timeStyle`, the
// numeric and short/long field options, `timeZone` "UTC" or the system's),
// `Intl.PluralRules` (`select`) and `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`. Other `Intl`
// members are absent.
//
// The project's tsconfig should use `"lib": ["ES2022"]` (which declares
// BigInt and the BigInt typed arrays) and `"types": []`:
// the runtime is not a browser and has no DOM. The globals below are the
// only ones beyond ECMAScript.

  // (`engine.limits.fuel_ms`, 32 ms of the reference machine's instructions
  // by default; `onStart` gets eight times it). A call that spends its fuel
  // is paused, not ended: it continues with fresh fuel on the following
  // frames while the game draws nothing new, and once it has run too long
  // the player sees the not-responding screen, where Wait lets it go on and
  // Stop ends the game. The budgets by phase (browsers have no fuel, and the
  // same not-responding limits):
  //
  //   phase                                fuel                 not responding after
  //   module evaluation (module scope,     60 s in all; cannot  9 s, with onStart
  //     the entry and its imports)         pause
  //   onStart and its promise jobs         8 x fuel_ms a slice  9 s (with module scope)
  //   a frame: events, timers,             fuel_ms an entry     3 s for the whole frame
  //     onFixedUpdate, onUpdate,
  //     onRender, promise jobs

  //   onQuit                               fuel_ms              closes after 1 s
  //
  // While the game is busy (`setBusy`) the not-responding screen waits 60 s.
  // Module evaluation that spends its 60 s, or a call looping inside a
  // built-in's callback (a sort comparator) past a long overdraft, ends the
  // game with an error naming the phase, the time it ran and the limit:
  // "module evaluation of src/main.ts ran past its time budget (it ran
  // 61234 ms; the limit is 60000 ms of the reference machine's
  // instructions)". `starhermit check` fails a game that would show the
  // not-responding screen, saying which phase ran how long. Long work
  // should be sliced across frames (`fuelLeft()` says how much of this
  // call's fuel remains) or announced with `setBusy`. Running out of heap

  // ES 3.00, WGSL), so the same code draws on Vulkan, Direct3D 12, OpenGL
  // ES, WebGPU and WebGL2. It is sandboxed: a part declares structs,
  // constants and functions only (no variables, bindings, entry points or
  // attributes, no names the engine declares, nothing starting with `_`),
  // reads no engine globals but `uniforms` and its textures, and loops only
  // with `for (var i = A; i < B; i++)` over constant bounds and step (any of
  // <, <=, >, >=, ++, --, += k, -= k; at most 65,536 iterations, nested
  // loops together); WGSL has no recursion. Derivatives (dpdx, dpdy,
  // fwidth) and textureSample stay in uniform control flow (outside
  // branches and loops on per-pixel values; branching on `uniforms` and
  // constants is fine), as WebGPU requires; vertex code samples with
  // textureSampleLevel and cannot discard. Each part is at most 64 KiB.

  //     position and normal in object space; color the instance color times
  //     the vertex color (when the material has vertexColors; white
  //     otherwise), each also given alone (instance_color, which includes
  //     the InstancedMesh's color, 0..65504, and vertex_color: a game may
  //     carry data in them and set color itself); custom the
  //     geometry's `custom` attribute (zeros without one); instance the
  //     InstancedMesh's `instanceCustom` (zeros otherwise); clip zero, or
  //     set by the hook (w not 0) to place the vertex in clip space itself
  //     (depth -1..1 as view_projection() gives; the shadow pass ignores
  //     it); v0..v3 four varyings for the fragment stage.
