// StarHermit host API, version 1: the built-in modules a script game imports
// by name (`import { onUpdate } from "starhermit:engine"`). The runtime
// (`starhermit`) is the only trusted code; a game package is data, and every
// host object it receives is an opaque handle the runtime validates on each
// call.
//
// A game runs natively in the runtime's own interpreter and in browsers in
// the browser's engine (V8). What differs between the two (modules that
// import each other, built-ins only browsers have, local time, limits) is
// listed in spec/script-games.html, "Known differences between the native
// interpreter and V8"; `starhermit check` links the game's modules as
// browsers get them and warns of globals only browsers have.
//
// Conventions for every module:
//
// - Errors. A wrong argument type, a non-finite number where a number is
//   needed, or a handle that was disposed, forged or belongs to another
//   object throws a `TypeError`. Going past a limit (the manifest's
//   `engine.limits.*`, a per-frame bound, a size) throws a `RangeError`.
//   Where a web API is the model, its DOMException cases throw an `Error`
//   whose `name` is the DOMException name (`IndexSizeError`,
//   `SyntaxError`, `InvalidStateError`, `NotSupportedError`,
//   `InvalidAccessError`, `NotAllowedError`), so `e.name` checks port
//   unchanged. Platform calls reject with a `PlatformError`
//   (`starhermit:platform`). Once the runtime has asked the game to stop,
//   every host call throws.
// - Units. World distances are meters, angles radians (except
//   `PerspectiveCamera.fov`, degrees as in three.js), times seconds
//   (platform timestamps are milliseconds since the Unix epoch, as the
//   platform sends them), window coordinates physical pixels from the
//   top-left corner (`frame().scale` converts to logical pixels).
// - Colors (`ColorLike`) are sRGB: a CSS color string (`"#ff8800"`,
//   `"rgb(255 136 0 / 50%)"`, a named color), a `0xRRGGBB` number, or
//   `[r, g, b]` / `[r, g, b, a]` with components 0–1. Scene colors are
//   converted to linear light for lighting, as three.js does.
// - Light intensities keep the engine's convention: a white surface facing
//   a light of color 1 and intensity 1 shows its base color. three.js
//   r155+ divides direct and ambient light by π, so a ported light uses
//   `threeIntensity / Math.PI`.
// - Callbacks. Lifecycle callbacks are registered once at the top level of
//   the entry module; input events arrive at the start of each frame,
//   before `onFixedUpdate`. Asynchronous host work (asset loads, platform
//   calls, permission prompts) resolves promises between frames; waiting on
//   it costs no fuel and never counts as not responding.
// - Resources. A handle's resource (a node, mesh, material, texture,
//   canvas, bitmap, sound, socket, worker…) counts against its budget
//   until `dispose()`, `close()` or `release()`, which free it at once, or
//   until the collector finds the handle unreachable: natively at the end
//   of the call in which that collection ends, which the runtime drives as
//   the game makes scene and canvas resources, so dropped ones are
//   released before their budgets fill; and a creation a budget would
//   refuse first collects and releases what was dropped. In browsers the
//   browser's collector decides when, so dispose what you drop when a
//   budget is tight.
// - Version. `engine.API_VERSION` is this file's major version (the
//   manifest's `engine.api=1`); minor versions only add members.
//
// Tools. The runtime carries this file and the developer commands, so a game
// needs nothing else: `starhermit new DIR` writes a new script game pinned to
// the runtime's engine release, `starhermit types DIR` writes this file as
// `DIR/.starhermit/starhermit.d.ts` (a dot-name, so no package carries it; the
// game's tsconfig.json lists it), `starhermit check DIR` validates the package
// and plays it headless, `starhermit DIR` plays it, `starhermit package
// --native DIR` writes its file index for a folder upload the StarHermit
// client installs and plays natively, and `starhermit package --web DIR --out
// UPLOAD` writes its web upload, its loader pinned to the same release on
// https://wiki.starhermit.com/engine/. `cargo starhermit` has the same
// commands for engine developers.
//
// Modules. Scripts are ECMAScript modules; `import` takes the built-in
// `starhermit:<module>` names and package files by a specifier relative to
// the importing file (`"./logic/pose.ts"`, `"../shared/sim.js"`); there are
// no bare specifiers, package-absolute paths or import maps. A specifier
// that names an existing package file loads it. Otherwise one ending in
// `.js` or `.mjs` loads the `.ts` or `.mts` file of the same stem (the
// TypeScript compiler's convention), and an extensionless one tries `.ts`,
// `.mts`, `.js` and `.mjs` in that order; directories are not resolved to
// an index file. A query string or fragment on a relative specifier
// (`"./settings.js?v=11"`, web cache-busting) is ignored for resolution:
// a module's identity is its resolved path, so `./a.js?v=1` and `./a.js`
// are one module, evaluated once. A specifier that resolves to nothing, or
// outside the package, ends the game on the error screen naming the
// importing file and the specifier. Dynamic `import()` resolves the same way and rejects
// instead. `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` with
// `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true` type-checks every accepted form.
//
// Language. Strict-mode ECMAScript 2022 plus TypeScript syntax (erased).
// Natively the interpreter erases the types; on the web the same eraser
// hands each module to the browser's engine as JavaScript with every line
// where it was (columns too, but on the line of an enum or of a parameter
// property's constructor or class body), and `starhermit check` parses and
// links what it hands over. Supported: annotations and return types
// anywhere (also over several lines before an arrow's `=>`), generics
// (`<T,>(x: T) => x` in arrows), `as`, `as const`, `satisfies`, `!`,
// `x!: T`, optional members, `declare` fields and declarations, `abstract`
// classes and members, overloads, index signatures, interfaces and type
// aliases, `import type`, `export type` and inline `type` specifiers (an
// import used only as a type is left out), `implements`, accessibility and
// `readonly` modifiers, enums and const enums (compiled to objects) and
// parameter properties (fields declared before the class's own and
// assigned as the constructor starts, after `super()`: TypeScript for
// ES2022). Not supported, refused natively and by check: decorators,
// value namespaces (type-only namespaces erase), `import x = require()`
// and `import x = N.y`, auto-accessors, JSX, `<T>x` assertions broken
// across lines after `return`, `throw` or `yield` (use `as`), and line
// breaks in an async arrow's type parameters (`async <T>` and its `(`
// on different lines); none of these would be JavaScript once erased.
// BigInt is included (literals, operators, `BigInt.asIntN`/`asUintN`,
// `BigInt64Array`, `BigUint64Array`, DataView's BigInt accessors, exact
// `toLocaleString` and `Intl.NumberFormat`). A BigInt holds at most
// 1,048,576 bits (2^20, about 315,000 decimal digits; V8 allows more): a
// result past that is a `RangeError` ("Maximum BigInt size exceeded"), and
// large-number work counts against the script's fuel like any other. The
// host API takes no BigInt: numeric and data parameters throw a
// `TypeError` for one (convert with `Number(x)` or `String(x)` first),
// `JSON.stringify` (so storage, saves, workers and platform calls) throws,
// `BigInt64Array`/`BigUint64Array` are not accepted where a typed array of
// numbers is, and `starhermit:world` kernels refuse BigInt (their numbers
// are doubles). Scene property fields convert one as `Number(x)` does, as
// the browser's engine does. `console.log(12n)` prints `12n`.
// Of `Intl` and the locale-aware members, these follow the player's
// language (BCP 47 tags; others fall back to it): `String.prototype.
// localeCompare` and `Intl.Collator` (Unicode root collation with
// `sensitivity` and `numeric`), `String.prototype.normalize`,
// `Number.prototype.toLocaleString` and `Intl.NumberFormat` (`style`
// decimal, percent, currency and unit; `currency` with `currencyDisplay`
// symbol, narrowSymbol, code or name and `currencySign` standard or
// accounting, digits defaulting to the currency's (JPY 0, KWD 3); fraction
// and integer digit options, `useGrouping`; `format`, `formatToParts`),
// `Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString`/`TimeString`/
// `String` and `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (`dateStyle`, `timeStyle`, the
// numeric and short/long field options, `timeZone` "UTC" or the system's),
// `Intl.PluralRules` (`select`) and `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`. Other `Intl`
// members are absent.
//
// The project's tsconfig should use `"lib": ["ES2022"]` (which declares

  // (`engine.limits.fuel_ms`, 32 ms of the reference machine's instructions

  // is paused, not ended: it continues with fresh fuel on the following

  // the player sees the not-responding screen, where Wait lets it go on and
  // Stop ends the game. The budgets by phase (browsers have no fuel, and the

  //   phase                                fuel                 not responding after

  // While the game is busy (`setBusy`) the not-responding screen waits 60 s.

   * names a package may not hold throw a TypeError. A read returns at most
   * 64 MiB (RangeError; a ranged `readBytes` reads part of a larger file).
   * Reads are synchronous: packages are local.
   *
   * Remote files (since API_MINOR 7) are package files the game's own
   * hosts serve: starhermit.txt marks them (`engine.remote.files=models/**`)
   * and names the hosts (`engine.remote.urls=https://…/`; since API_MINOR
   * 8 also `platform`, the StarHermit platform the game is published on,
   * which serves them on the game's own origin), and packaging
   * pins each by size and SHA-256. They are in `exists`, `size` and `list`
   * like any file. The asynchronous loaders (`TextureLoader`, `GLTFLoader`,
   * `loadClip`, `AudioContext.loadBuffer`, `createImageBitmap(path)`) fetch
   * the remote files they load; the synchronous reads take a remote file
   * once this run made it ready (`files.fetch`, or a loader that loaded it)
   * and otherwise throw an Error saying to fetch it first, natively and in
   * browsers alike. A file whose bytes do not match the package's pin is
   * never used. Run from a game's directory, a remote file the directory
   * holds is read from it (development).
   *
   * In browsers the page fetches the package's images, sounds, fonts and
   * video only when the game loads them. The asynchronous loaders never
   * wait for a file (natively they read it off the game's thread); a
   * synchronous read of one the page has not fetched gets it, but the
   * page waits meanwhile and the console warns, naming the file and the
   * API that read it: `files.fetch` it first.
   *
   * Development files are no part of the package, in development as once
   * uploaded: names starting with a dot, by default `node_modules/`,
   * `tsconfig.json`, `jsconfig.json`, `package.json` and the npm, yarn and
   * pnpm lock files, source maps (`*.js.map`, `*.mjs.map`, `*.ts.map`,
   * `*.css.map`), `Thumbs.db` and `desktop.ini`, and what the game's
   * `.starhermitignore` lists (gitignore-style rules; `!name` keeps a
   * default). Such a file does not exist for the game: a read or import of
   * one fails with a `NotFoundError` (a load error for an import) that
   * names the rule, so `starhermit check` catches a static import. One
   * exception, for development config that is never uploaded: a native
   * `--dev` run of a package directory reads the files the game's own
   * `.starhermitignore` leaves out (`exists`, `size`, `status` and
   * the reads see them; not dot-names, not the defaults, not imports) and
   * the console warns once a file: `files: "config/dev.json" is read only
   * in development: not part of the package (…)`. Normal runs, checks and
   * browsers see the package only, as players do, so guard such reads

   * (16,384 pixels on a side, 16,777,216 in all) or with no image budget

  // The per-frame 2D overlay over the 3D scene (HUDs), drawn in call order

  // characters a frame (RangeError). The runtime's own interface always
  // draws above it. The frame's overlay draws at most 262,144 vertices
  // (three a triangle): a frame past them draws none of its overlay (the
  // console says so once: "2D vertex budget exceeded"). `box` is the
  // costly item: a plain box takes a few dozen vertices, a gradient a few
  // hundred, and a repeating radial gradient a ring at each stop of each
  // period (about 5,200 for hard rings every 10 pixels over a 120-pixel
  // box, so about fifty such boxes fill the budget).
  //
  // Fonts. Text in no family the game added draws with the operating
  // system's fonts, as browsers map the generic families: `system-ui` (the
  // default; Segoe UI on Windows, DejaVu Sans on Linux), `sans-serif`
  // (Arial, Liberation Sans or DejaVu Sans), `serif`, `monospace`,
  // `cursive` and `fantasy`; characters a face lacks take the next face
  // that has them (other system families, Segoe UI Symbol on Windows), and
  // the engine's 5 × 7 pixel font (`starhermit pixel`, printable ASCII,
  // `· × — …` and the arrows) comes last, so a machine without system fonts
  // still draws ASCII. On common systems that covers Latin-1, Latin
  // Extended-A and general punctuation (`é`, `ß`, `–`, `’`); symbols such as
  // `★` depend on the system. Besides its own emoji font (below), the
  // runtime ships no font file and reads fonts only from the system's font
  // directories; games name them only
  // by the generic families (a system family's own name, such as `Arial`,
  // is not a family here, so text cannot tell which fonts the system has).
  // Exact metrics (widths,
  // line heights) differ between systems, as on the web: measure text
  // (`measureText`) rather than assume widths.
  //
  // Emoji draw in colour from the engine's own emoji font, StarHermit
  // Emoji, the same on every system and in browsers: in `text` and
  // `measureText` here, in `starhermit:ui`, and in a canvas's `fillText`
  // and `measureText` (`strokeText` strokes an emoji's outline in the
  // stroke style, as browsers do). It comes after every other face, just
  // before the pixel font, except that an emoji drawn in emoji style by
  // default (Emoji_Presentation, such as `😀 🔴 ⭐`) takes it over a
  // system face's black-and-white form, as browsers prefer their emoji
  // font. U+FE0F after a character asks for emoji style (`❤️`, where `❤`
  // alone is text style), U+FE0E for text style; neither draws anything.
  // An emoji's own colours draw whatever the text's color (its opacity
  // still applies), except parts the font gives the text's color (as it
  // draws text-style symbols such as `✔ ☀`). The font is original art,
  // under the engine's licence, and has 711 glyphs: the common single
  // emoji, one code point each (an emoji it lacks draws with the faces
  // before it, or as the pixel font's box), and the twelve keycaps
  // (`0`–`9`, `#` or `*`, U+FE0F, U+20E3: `2️⃣ #️⃣`, also without the
  // U+FE0F), each one key drawn the same everywhere. U+20E3 never draws
  // on its own: anywhere else the character before it draws as plain
  // text. This version draws no other emoji sequences: in a ZWJ sequence
  // (`👩‍💻`) each emoji draws on its own and the joiner draws nothing, a
  // skin-tone modifier is dropped (the emoji draws in its default tone),
  // and a flag draws as its two regional indicator letters where a face
  // has them. The font loads the
  // first time text needs it, never before (a game without emoji never
  // loads it): until it arrives, which takes a moment in a browser, emoji
  // draw as nothing in the room they take once it is in (an em each), so
  // text keeps its layout, and then they draw. Nothing waits or throws.

  // The engine's immediate-mode UI for the game's own menus and HUD panels:
  // call widgets every frame (from `onUpdate` or `onRender`) and they return
  // what the player did. It lays out, draws into the overlay (after
  // `starhermit:draw`), takes pointer, touch, keyboard (Tab, arrows,
  // Enter, Escape) and gamepad navigation (D-pad or left stick, South to
  // activate, East to go back), follows the player's UI scale, text size,
  // contrast and reduced-motion settings (see `preferences`), and builds an
  // accessibility tree screen readers read. Labels are the widgets' identities unless `id()`
  // names them, so keep them stable or set ids for translated labels. At
  // most 4,096 widgets a frame (RangeError). A click or tap needs its press
  // and its release on the same widget, each counted where it happened, so
  // one that comes and goes between two frames (a quick tap on a slow
  // frame) still clicks; a frame clicks at most once, and further taps
  // between two frames click in the frames after it, in order.

  // Sizes. What the game passes is logical pixels: theme sizes, text sizes,
  // padding, spacing, and layout, paragraph, slider, field, progress, image
  // and scroll-area sizes. Each frame the UI multiplies them by
  // `preferences().scale` (the window's scale factor times the player's
  // interface size) and text sizes by `textScale` on top, as the runtime's
  // own menu does; a change the player makes in the Options menu shows on
  // the next frame. What the UI returns is window pixels: rectangles,
  // scroll offsets, `measureText`. Rectangles the game gives (`setViewport`,
  // `area`) are window pixels too. A game that places widgets itself
  // measures them with `measureText` (never `starhermit:draw`'s, which is
  // unscaled) and divides window pixels by `scale` for the logical sizes it
  // passes back: a column as wide as its widest label is
  // `{ width: widest / ui.preferences().scale }`; a screen-filling one is
  // `frame().width / ui.preferences().scale` wide, not `/ frame().scale`.

  // Fonts. Text draws with the default faces (`system-ui`), `setFont`'s
  // family or a text option's (`TextOptions.font`), each falling back as
  // `starhermit:draw`'s text does: the system's faces, then the engine's
  // emoji font and pixel font. Emoji draw in colour from the engine's own
  // emoji font, StarHermit Emoji, loaded the first time text needs it;
  // until then they keep their room and draw nothing, and measured widths
  // (`measureText`) are already theirs. Single emoji and keycaps (`2️⃣`)
  // only in this version: ZWJ sequences draw as their emoji one by one,
  // skin tones are dropped, flags draw as regional indicator letters (see
  // "Emoji" in `starhermit:draw`).

  // -- Styles (since API_MINOR 12) ---------------------------------------
  //
  // Looks a game registers once (`setStyles`) by widget kind (`"button"`)
  // and class (`".primary"`), and widgets name each frame (`style()`), so
  // menus can look like the game's original HTML and CSS while focus,
  // keyboard, gamepad, touch, screen readers and the player's settings
  // keep working. A widget's look is, in order, later winning: the
  // theme's defaults for its kind, the game's kind style, the `inside`
  // rules of its enclosing containers (outermost first), its classes in
  // the order given, and inline styles; then, for each of its states, the
  // state blocks of those in the order first, last, odd, even (where it
  // is among its container's children), hoverWithin, focusWithin,
  // hovered, focused, focusVisible, checked, selected, pressed, disabled
  // (CSS's practical precedence: a selected tool keeps its look under the
  // pointer, a press shows while held, disabled wins over all), whichever
  // rule gave the block: a kind's `hovered` loses to an `inside` rule's
  // `selected`. Each
  // property replaces what came before it (`background`, `shadow` and
  // `decorations` as a whole, as in CSS), except `padding`, `border` and
  // `text`, whose fields merge. Sizes are logical pixels. Sizes are
  // border-box (CSS `box-sizing: border-box`): a style's or layout's
  // `width` and `height` are the outer size, padding and border included,
  // so a port of content-box CSS adds the padding and border to its
  // widths. On widgets that hold text they are minimums (text never cuts:
  // it grows the box, or ellipsizes with `text.overflow`).
  //
  // The player's settings apply last and win: the interface size scales
  // every size (borders stay at least a pixel), the text size scales text,
  // and high contrast forces colors as CSS `forced-colors` does: one solid
  // fill by role and state (panels and controls black, hovered and pressed
  // greys, selected the theme's selection blue), white text (grey when
  // disabled), white borders at least 1 wide on controls (yellow when
  // focused or selected), no shadows, decorations in the text color,
  // opacity 1, and a yellow focus ring at least 3 wide even where a style
  // says `"none"`. Shapes, sizes, fonts and spacing stay.
  //
  // Styles are checked when registered: an unknown key or a value of the
  // wrong shape throws a TypeError (a typo CSS would ignore), a bound a
  // RangeError, and a call that throws registers nothing. A class named
  // with no style registered draws as if unnamed, with one warning in
  // the console (none for a class some `inside` rule names). Tokens are checked where used: one missing or of the
  // wrong kind leaves that property as it was, with one warning. Styles
  // are resolved once per combination of rules and state and cached, so a
  // frame's widgets cost a lookup each; register them once, not per frame.
  //
  // Widgets: buttons, labels, headings and paragraphs lay out and draw
  // whole by their style (padding, border, sizes, box and text). Containers
  // (`column`, `row`, `panel`, `scrollArea`, `dialog`) draw their box
  // behind their children and take its padding. `checkbox`, `slider`,
  // `progress`, `meter`, `select`, `cycle`, `textField` and `tabs` (each
  // tab) take the box behind them, the text color and the focus ring, and
  // since API_MINOR 12 their parts (`parts`: the slider's `track` and
  // `thumb`, the checkbox's `box` and `mark`, the select's `field`, `list`
  // and `option`, progress bars' and meters' `track` and `fill`, the tabs'
  // `strip` and `tab`, the dialog's `backdrop`, a scroll area's `track`
  // and `bar`) take their own; a part no style gives a look keeps the
  // theme's.
  //
  // The focus ring shows for focus the player sees (CSS
  // `:focus-visible`, since API_MINOR 12): focus moved by the keyboard,
  // a gamepad, `setFocus` or a screen reader. A press or tap focuses the
  // widget without it. `focused` matches any focus, `focusVisible` only
  // the former.
  //
  // Boxes past a frame's budget (131,072 vertices of styled boxes) draw
  // without shadows from the next frame, then without gradients (their
  // first color), never without content.

  //
  // A worker is a package script in a realm of its own on a thread of its
  // own, so its work leaves the game's thread (since API_MINOR 2). It gets the platform
  // sandbox's rules and nothing of the host: no imports of built-in
  // modules, no `Date`, no `Math.random`, no timers, and `Intl` dates read
  // the epoch (an authority's: the invocation's `ctx.now`). It and the game
  // exchange JSON only: a message is copied as JSON text (at most 1 MiB,
  // nesting at most 128 deep; functions and `undefined` are left out as
  // `JSON.stringify` leaves them, and a host object arrives as `{}`), and
  // what a worker sends reaches the game's listeners as each frame begins,
  // before `onFixedUpdate`, in the order it was sent.
  //
  // Limits. A game runs at most 4 workers and authorities at once (one
  // that was terminated counts until its thread has ended). Each has its
  // own heap (`heapMiB`, 32 MiB by default) reserved out of the game's:
  // while its thread lives, the game's realm may use that much less, so
  // workers never add to `engine.limits.heap_mib`; a reservation larger
  // than the game's heap has left throws a RangeError. Its call depth is
  // the manifest's `call_frames`, and every entry (the script's top level,
  // each message, an authority's each invocation) gets the manifest's
  // `fuel_ms`. At most 256 messages (4 MiB) wait for a worker and 1,024
  // (8 MiB) for the game; past that a send is refused and counted in
  // `stats.overflows`. A worker whose one entry has run three seconds is
  // reported with an `error` and the state `"not-responding"` (the game
  // may terminate it); the game's own frames never wait for it. Its
  // console lines go to the game's log, prefixed with its path. Stopping
  // the game stops its workers where they stand, and a restart waits for
  // their threads. Keep a reference to a worker you use: one the game no
  // longer holds is terminated when it is collected.
